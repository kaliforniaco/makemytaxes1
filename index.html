        <p>
            Levies can really do a lot of damage & even ruin your life. 
            A levy is the IRS's way of getting your immediate attention. 
            What they are saying is, we have tried to communicate with you 
            but you have ignored us. Levies are used to seize your wages & 
            whatever other assets you have. If you own it, they can take it. 
            That includes checking accounts, autos, stocks, bonds, boats, 
            paychecks, & even Social Security checks!

        <p>
            Owing money to the IRS is a very serious issue, but it 
            isnâ€™t a cause for panic. An experienced tax specialist can 
            work with the IRS on your behalf to resolve complex problems 
            that you can't otherwise be able to handle on your own. 
            Below are just a few situations that a tax resolution 
            service can help with.

        <p>
            Did you know that you can get out of the tax debt due 
            to the misdeeds or fraud committed by your spouse? 
            Innocent Spouse Relief was designed to alleviate unjust 
            situations where one spouse was clearly the victim of 
            fraud perpetrated by their spouse or ex-spouse.
